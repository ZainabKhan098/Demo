                        <p>
                            In 1980, physicist <a class="xyz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at CERN proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer <a class="xyz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau" target="_blank">Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" an <em>encyclopedia</em> is the first entry.

                        <h2>What is HTML</h2>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> and scripting languages such as <em>JavaScript,</em> a programming language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to organize and format text, images, links, and other elements on a webpage. These tags, enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs or &lt;h1&gt; for headings), tell the browser how to render the content. Without HTML, webpages would lack structure and consistency, making it difficult to navigate or style them effectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, HTML has evolved through multiple versions, with HTML5 being the latest major iteration. HTML5 introduced new semantic elements (like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;), multimedia support (e.g., &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tags), and improved APIs for richer web applications. Today, HTML remains the foundation of the modern web, working alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity to create dynamic, user-friendly experiences.
